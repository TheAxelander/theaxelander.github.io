Its naming defines for what kind of expense the money will be spent in future, optionally it can have a due date in case you know when the expense will happen. Another use case for a bucket can be a deposit for long-term savings. Overall you can put money into buckets and later on take it out to finance the respecitve expense or to move it to another bucket.</p> <p>Putting money in and out from buckets happens in OpenBudgeteer in an automated way, but can be also done manually.

Once you assign a bank transaction to this bucket, the money will be taken out again and typically the balance is 0. For the next month the same procedure starts again.</p> <p>But there can be some cases where you just don't know how much money you will spend in this month like for groceries, car costs, free time costs etc. Here you make an estimate on how much money will be required for every month with a fixed value. If this estimate variates you rather want to use the Standard Bucket.

The required amount will be distributed over the whole timeline which means every month you put small amounts into this bucket and in the final month you have enough savings to finance the expense. The progress will be visualized with a progress bar in OpenBudgeteer.</p> <p>After that the next interation starts and for every month the expected amount will be calculated again.
